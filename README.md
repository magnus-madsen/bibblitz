# BibBlitz ðŸ“šâš¡

A program to convert a JSON file into a `.bibtex` file using CrossRef.

## Usage

Given a JSON file `refs.json` with the content:

```json
{
  "lutze2023": "10.1145/3607846",
  "lutze2024": "10.1145/3656393",
  "madsen2025": "10.1145/3763126"
}
```

You can create a `refs.bib` by running:

```sh
java -jar bibblitz.jar refs.json refs.bib
```

The program will fetch metadata from CrossRef and display progress:

```
[Info] Parsed 'refs.json'. Found 3 DOIs.
[Info] Fetching data from CrossRef.
[Info] [1/3] Fetched 'lutze2023'.
[Info] [2/3] Fetched 'lutze2024'.
[Info] [3/3] Fetched 'madsen2025'.
[Info] Wrote BibTeX entries to 'refs.bib'.
```

### Example Output

The generated `refs.bib` file will contain:

```bibtex
